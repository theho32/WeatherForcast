# WeatherForcast
WeatherApp

Weather application built from scratch. I used this project to learn how to gather information from openweathermap.org using their api. This app allows you to input what city you want the weather about and then it will display the current weather with a forcast of extra 2 days. It will display the Day, Condition, Description, Wind speed and Temperature. This 

Bugs: Bug where if you don't input a valid city app will crash.
      Todays weather the "Sun" is brown.
